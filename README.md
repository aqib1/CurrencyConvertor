# CurrencyConvertor

# Task
Let's walk through this task: 
1. Create a new Java / Kotlin Micro-Service Application, utilizing Spring Boot. 
2. Serve the following API endpoints: 
   Output the current time (as valid JSON) Convert currency inputs endpoint:  /api/currency/convert 
   inputs:
        amount (in source-currency), source-currency, target-currency 
   output: 
        amount in target-currency (as valid JSON) you may use static conversion data or connect to a public converter (e.g. https://currencylayer.com/documentation) Validate a VAT input and return input: potential VAT number output: country (code) for VAT number (as valid JSON) you may use a static mapping or connect to a public api (e.g. https://api.cloudmersive.com/swagger/index.html? urls.primaryName=Validate%20API) 
3. Add unit-test coverage as appropriate. 
4. Ensure the service can be built, tested, and run. The service should run on port 8081 

BONUS: 
incorporate an embedded DB/caching layer for your API endpoints 
BONUS: 
The service includes autogenerated swagger documentation. 

5. Add a README to: describe the application, the pre-requisites, how to run it, additional notes, etc. 
6. Package the app and share a download link to the source-code or private GitHub repository. 

WARNING: DO NOT INCLUDE THE BUILD/OUTPUT. We expect to be able to build, test, and run it ourselves. Please do not make the source-code public. 
BONUS: dockerize your application (i.e. include a DockerÔ¨Åle, docker-compose.yml, and relevant README instructions)

# Solution
For implementation as Micro-service architecture, Spring cloud technology is used, Netflix Eureka server is used for service registry. 
For the sake of this task, a single micro-service as the eureka client is created along with a eureka server.
The complete application is created using the test-driven approach. That's is the reason application contains a large number of test cases.
In netflix-client, two controllers are written, which details on abstraction level is given hereinafter.
 - CurrencyConverterController
 - VATController
CurrencyConverterController is a rest controller which further consists of two types of API, keep in mind that each rest API is created while keeping in mind of the 2nd-degree maturity level of  Rest API level defined by Richardson, In future commits, API will be upgraded to 3rd degree using HATEOAS.
# Currency Converter
Currency Converter API consists on two API's 
- /api/currency/convert
- /api/currency/convert/details
First API will going to return convertion detailes as it was asked in task, second API return details with some additional information
